# Create a main class that will be used to hold my routes function, my function that executes the traveling salesman algorithm, and my main function that will run the program

# Create function that will determine each possible route and holds some key logic for determining the shortest route

# Create a helper function that will receive the possible routes from the routes method and execute the traveling salesman algorithm

# Create a main function that will run the program
