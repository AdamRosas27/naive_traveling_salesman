# Traveling Salesman Problem Solver

This Python program focuses on solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a brute-force approach. It finds the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city. The project also provides a basic structure for organizing and managing the code.

## Introduction

The code in this repository solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a brute-force approach. It calculates the shortest route that visits a specified set of cities and returns to the starting city. The program defines a `Main` class that contains functions for determining possible routes and finding the shortest route using permutations from the `itertools` library. 

## Features

- Calculation of the shortest route for the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- Efficient use of permutations to explore all possible routes.
- Demonstrates a basic structure for organizing Python code.

## Running the TSP Algorithm 
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main = Main()
    main.main()
```
